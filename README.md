# Object Detection Using TensorFlow

## Overview

This project demonstrates object detection using TensorFlow, leveraging both Python and JavaScript implementations. The goal is to provide a comprehensive approach to object detection that can be utilized in various applications, from real-time detection on the web to robust backend processing in Python.

## Features

- *Real-time Detection*: Enables real-time object detection using TensorFlow.
- *Dual Implementation*: Offers both Python and JavaScript implementations for versatility.
- *High Accuracy*: Utilizes TensorFlowâ€™s powerful models for accurate object detection.
- *Cross-Platform*: Can be deployed on web applications and standalone Python environments.

## How It Works

### Python Implementation

1. *Load Model*: Utilizes TensorFlow to load a pre-trained object detection model.
2. *Preprocess Images*: Prepares the input images by resizing and normalizing.
3. *Detect Objects*: Runs the detection model on the input images to identify objects.
4. *Visualize Results*: Outputs images with bounding boxes around detected objects.

### JavaScript Implementation

1. *Load Model*: Loads a TensorFlow.js model for object detection.
2. *Setup Webcam*: Initializes the webcam for real-time image capture.
3. *Detect Objects*: Uses the model to detect objects in the webcam feed.
4. *Visualize Results*: Displays the webcam feed with bounding boxes around detected objects.
